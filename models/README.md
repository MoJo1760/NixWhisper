# Models

This directory contains the Whisper models used by NixWhisper. By default, models will be downloaded automatically when first used and stored here.

## Managing Models

### Default Model
NixWhisper uses the  model by default, which provides a good balance between accuracy and performance.

### Using Different Models
To use a different model, simply place the model files in this directory. The model should be in the format expected by the  library.

### Available Models
-  - Fastest but least accurate
-  - Good balance (default)
-  - Better accuracy, slower
-  - High accuracy, slower
-  - Best accuracy, slowest

### Model Files
Model files are not included in version control due to their size. They will be automatically downloaded when needed.
