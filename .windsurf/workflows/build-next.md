---

- task-master-ai MCP is already installed, you do not need to install it.
- Use the task-master-ai MCP to get the next task
- Use the task-master-ai MCP to mark the task as in-progress
- Keep track of the current task in your memory
- Evaluate the existing code base and patterns to make sure that we are being consistent
- Complete the task, following the PEP-8 standards for Python Coding Practices
- Create unit tests for the feature
- Test the feature, fixing any code that is not passing
- Use pylint to maintain high code quality of 10/10 for functional code and 5/10 for unit tests
- Repeat the testing and pylint steps until all code is passing all tests and the linting scores is meeting our standards
- Use the task-master-ai MCP to update the current task and mark it as done
- If this is the last subtask of a parent task, use the task-master MCP to mark the parent task as done as well
- continue with all recommend next steps using this workflow until the task is feature complete
- Commit changes to git
- push changes to the repo
