# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Offline Real-Time Dictation System for Linux

---

## 1. Overview

Build a native, offline, real-time speech-to-text dictation system for Linux desktops and laptops. The solution will be privacy-first, open-source, and focused on high-accuracy English transcription. It will feature a modal GUI, user model management, and keyboard-activated listening. The system should seamlessly allow users to dictate text wherever they can type, with extensibility for future integrations and languages.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Linux users lack a robust, privacy-focused, offline dictation tool with real-time feedback and deep integration into everyday workflows. Existing solutions are often cloud-based, lack privacy, or do not integrate well with diverse Linux applications.

---

## 3. Goals and Objectives

- Deliver accurate, real-time English speech-to-text dictation
- Ensure all processing is local and offline for privacy
- Provide a clear, intuitive modal GUI with real-time feedback (e.g., spectrograph)
- Allow users to activate dictation via keyboard shortcut with clear “listening” feedback
- Enable model swapping, defaulting to OpenWhisper models
- Allow user customization for formatting, macros, and commands
- Offer a standalone binary for easy open-source distribution and compilation

---

## 4. Target Users

- Writers, journalists, and content creators
- Developers and technical professionals
- Students, researchers, and productivity-focused users
- Privacy-conscious individuals and organizations

## 5. Key Features

### Core Features

- **Real-Time Dictation**: Accurate, low-latency, English speech-to-text transcription
- **Offline Operation**: All data processed locally; no network dependency
- **Modal GUI**: 
  - Spectrograph or visual indicator when listening
  - Not “always on”—requires user keypress to activate
  - Positive feedback (visual and/or audio) when active
- **Keyboard Shortcut Activation**: User-configurable hotkey to toggle dictation mode
- **Universal Typing Integration**: System-level input so dictated text appears wherever users can type (editors, browsers, IDEs, office suites, etc.)
- **Model Management**: 
  - Default to OpenWhisper models
  - Allow users to add/swap models as desired
- **Customization**: 
  - Formatting commands (e.g., “new paragraph”, “bullet point”)
  - Key-phrase macros for inserting predefined text or executing simple actions

### Bonus/Stretch Features

- **API/Plugin Support**: For integration with VS Code, Windsurf, Cursor, and major office suites
- **Pre-recorded Audio Transcription**: Option to transcribe audio files (not just live dictation)
- **Clipboard Integration**: Option to copy dictated text to clipboard

---

## 6. Technical Requirements

- **Platform**: Native Linux application (GTK or Qt recommended for GUI)
- **Programming Language**: Rust, C++, or Python (with compiled dependencies for performance)
- **Speech Model**: Local OpenWhisper model support; user model management
- **Audio Input**: Microphone support, robust error handling for device selection
- **Performance**: Real-time or near-real-time on typical consumer hardware (x86_64)
- **Security**: No data leaves device; all processing and storage is local
- **Distribution**: Standalone binary; open-source repository for user compilation

---

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Privacy-first**: Never transmits audio or text data externally
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling for hardware, permissions, and model issues
- **Usability**: Minimal setup, clear feedback, intuitive controls
- **Extensibility**: Modular design for future language/model/plugin support

---

## 8. Out of Scope

- ARM device support (future release)
- Non-English language support (future release)
- Mobile, Windows, or Mac support
- Compliance with specific regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)
- Accessibility features (unless requested in future)

---

## 9. Open Source Considerations

- Clear documentation for building from source
- Modular codebase for community contributions
- Well-defined contribution guidelines

---

## 10. Future Considerations

- ARM and additional language support
- Advanced plugin/API integrations
- Enhanced accessibility features
